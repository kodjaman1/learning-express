What makes an API RESTful?

1. HTTP methods.
get
post
put
patch
delete

2. A standard data format it responds with.
JSON generally.

3. Client-Server architecture.
Clients and servers are completely seperate.

4. Stateless
Each request can be processed without the knowledge
of the requests/responses before.

5. Resource-based.
Everything the application interacts with is a resource.
Resources are identified by URLs
